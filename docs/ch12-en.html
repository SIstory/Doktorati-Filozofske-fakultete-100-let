My only issue was my desire to pursue an interdisciplinary and quite challenging topic for my doctoral dissertation, but at the same time, it was different from the topics that prevailed in the doctoral study of art history in the 1980s and 1990s. The philosophical thought of Nikolai Kuzansky and Renaissance art in Italy; many people shrugged and advised me against the topic that seemed too exotic and extravagant. Nataša Golob was ready to accept it and even caught flak from certain colleagues. She made sure I got two great co-mentors: Professor Lev Menaše, who lectured New Age European Art at the department, and Professor Lev Kreft from the Department of Philosophy, who received the co-mentorship with great enthusiasm. Professor Golob gave me clear instructions and guidelines with fondness, the project started, and by 1997, I became one of her first Ph.D. students. I realized only later, when I myself lectured at the department, that I would never have completed my Ph.D. at the University of Ljubljana without her openness, breadth, and understanding. I wouldn't be able to choose another topic since I would not be able to research something I was not genuinely interested in. I am as grateful today for her selfless support and all the years of working together and friendship as when I was her student.</blockquote><div id="p-113" class="callout alert"><p align="justify"><strong><em>I am an art historian, but I have two PhDs: The Art History one on painted wooden ceilings in the Middle Ages, and the Literary History one on the Slovenian literature in the Middle Ages and its audience. Both PhDs are related both to each other and to what I received from my mentors, Luc Menaše and Nace Šumi. Luc Menaše gave me a wonderful framework for international developments in art history, while Nace Šumi influenced me with a very problem-oriented mentoring approach. Both were students of Izidor Cankar and France Stele, who brought to the University of Ljubljana only the best of what they received from the University of Vienna.<br itemprop="lb" /><br itemprop="lb" />I had no idea where my work would take me. It was a pursuit that led me to new monuments, new events, and new problems. Time and again, I found myself facing questions that demanded answers. As an art historian and literary historian, I follow the principles that were set at the beginning of the 20th century; namely that Slovenism is based on its history, its language, and its culture. I've been drawing from it all the time. On the other hand, my work has strengthened me in the belief that our realm was artistically, culturally and intellectually at an absolute height, completely equivalent to what happened in university cities such as Padua, Venice or Imperial Vienna, where our people played an important role. In all periods, they contributed to the formation of the intellectual and cultural pinnacle, especially during the period of Renaissance humanism. I have presented many of the findings of my research in books. I publish everywhere, mostly in England and Belgium, where there is a publishing house that specializes in the Middle Ages.<br itemprop="lb" /><br itemprop="lb" />I have also presented many of my research findings in short TV shows, exhibitions, and catalogs. This exhibition [on Ljubljana during the period of Bishop Lamberg, which reveals the lively but less-known era at the turn of the 14th to the 15th century; author's note] is my fifteenth. Each exhibition is a dialogue with the audience. The opportunity to display hundreds of manuscripts and fragments that are the most protected and rarely shown material from our heritage is actually a reader about our intellectual Middle Age. Members of the younger generation of art history in Slovenia are present everywhere in the world, especially in the field of Baroque and 20th-century art, with scholars from all over the world visiting us.</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ch11-en.html" title="Previous: JUSUF OSMANI, archivist (1986)  Archival material on the agrarian reform and colonization in Kosovo 1918–1941.
